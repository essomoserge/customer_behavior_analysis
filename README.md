# 📊 # Customer Behavior Analysis
## Data analytics project showcasing customer behavior analysis using Python, Sql and Power BI. An End-to-End Data Analytics Project

## Overview
This project demonstrates a complete end-to-end data analytics workflow aligned with real-world, company-level data analyst tasks. The objective is to analyze retail customer behavior and shopping trends and transform raw data into meaningful business insights using Python, SQL, and Power BI.

## Dataset
The dataset contains retail transaction and customer behavior data, including customer demographics, purchase amounts, product categories, discounts and promotions, subscription status, shipping types, and product review ratings. All data was cleaned and transformed to ensure consistency, accuracy, and readiness for analysis.

## Tools & Technologies
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- SQL (MySQL / SQL Server)
- Power BI
- Jupyter Notebook
- GitHub

## Project Workflow

### Data Loading & Exploratory Data Analysis (Python)
Loaded raw data using Pandas, performed exploratory data analysis (EDA), and identified missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies.

### Data Cleaning & Feature Engineering
Handled missing values using median imputation, standardized column names to snake_case, created new features (age_group, purchase_frequency_days), removed redundant fields, and ensured overall data consistency.

### Database Integration
Connected Python scripts to SQL databases and loaded cleaned data into PostgreSQL / MySQL / SQL Server to support analytical SQL queries.

### Data Analysis using SQL
Answered key business questions such as revenue comparison by gender, discount usage versus spending behavior, top-rated and most purchased products, subscriber versus non-subscriber spending, customer segmentation, and revenue contribution by age group.

## Power BI Dashboard
Developed an interactive Power BI dashboard to visualize revenue trends, customer segmentation, product performance, discount and subscription impact, and shipping type comparisons, enabling stakeholders to explore insights dynamically.

## Key Insights
Identified high-value customer segments, evaluated the effectiveness of discounts and subscriptions, highlighted top-performing products and categories, analyzed purchasing behavior across demographic groups, and delivered actionable insights for pricing and marketing strategies.

## Documentation & Presentation
Created a detailed project report documenting methodology, analysis, and findings, and developed an executive presentation using Gamma AI to communicate insights clearly to stakeholders.
